# About ‚ú® FireLion137 ‚ú®
Welcome to my GitHub profile!<br>
I am a Student and I am studying Computer Science at the University of Salerno in Italy<br><br>
I started to get passionate about IT from a very young age, using an old computer and by playing video games.<br>
As time went by I became more and more interested in technology in general and how the games or programs that I used so much as a kid were created, so I started to pursue my passions also in the world of study, choosing school and then later university that could be right for me.<br><br>
I am currently finishing my three-year cycle for the degree in computer science, during which I have refined my skills in coding, team work and management, time management and project design.<br>
Thanks to university projects and my curiosity to learn even outside of studies, I can say that I have a great mastery of the Java language and modular programming, specifically in the creation of Backend in Java using Spring Framework and MVC/Repository patterns. I am quite familiar with relational database languages, especially MySQL.
I also have good backend testing skills in Java using Mockito/JUnit and good knowledge on Frontend creation using Thymeleaf, basic CSS and Javascript/JQuery.<br>
I have experience in data management and manipulation to be used to train machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms created in Python.
I have some experience in C and C++ languages.<br>
One of the environments that I like the most is the creation of video games, so I have excellent knowledge of the basics of creating projects in Unity 3D and I am aiming to deepen my skills in this field.
